# Plan Item Constraint Violation Fix

## Problem Identified

The checkout process was failing with a **406 "Not Acceptable" error** when trying to create plan items. The error was actually a **unique constraint violation** `"ux_plan_items_plan_dog_recipe"` that was being misinterpreted as a 406 error.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Unique Constraint**: The `plan_items` table has a unique constraint on `(plan_id, dog_id, recipe_id)`
2. **Duplicate Creation**: The code was trying to create a new plan item when one already existed
3. **Error Misinterpretation**: The constraint violation was being reported as a 406 error instead of a proper constraint error

### Evidence

From the console logs:
```
[v0] Creating plan item for dog 1, recipe beef-quinoa-harvest...
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 ()
[v0] âœ… Plan item saved for dog 1, recipe beef-quinoa-harvest: f354ab34-4d4f-4ab9-a6b1-55a7780568a3
```

The plan item was actually created successfully (ID: `f354ab34-4d4f-4ab9-a6b1-55a7780568a3`), but the system was trying to create it again, causing the constraint violation.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Replaced Insert with Upsert

**Before:**
```typescript
// Complex logic to check for existing items and then insert/update
const { data: existingPlanItem, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from("plan_items")
  .select("id")
  .eq("plan_id", planId)
  .eq("dog_id", dogDbData.id)
  .eq("recipe_id", recipeData.id)
  .single()

if (existingPlanItem) {
  // Update existing item
  const { data: updatedPlanItem, error: updateError } = await supabase
    .from("plan_items")
    .update({...})
    .eq("id", existingPlanItem.id)
} else {
  // Create new item
  const { data: newPlanItem, error: planItemError } = await supabase
    .from("plan_items")
    .insert({...})
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Simple upsert operation
const { data: planItem, error: planItemError } = await supabase
  .from("plan_items")
  .upsert({
    plan_id: planId,
    dog_id: dogDbData.id,
    recipe_id: recipeData.id,
    qty: 1,
    size_g: sizeG,
    billing_interval: "week",
    stripe_price_id: stripePricing?.priceId,
    unit_price_cents: stripePricing?.amountCents || 2100,
    amount_cents: stripePricing?.amountCents || 2100,
    meta: {
      source: "wizard",
      dog_weight: weight,
      weight_unit: weightUnit,
      daily_grams: dailyGrams,
      monthly_grams: monthlyGrams,
      activity_level: dogData.dogProfile.activity,
      calculated_calories: Math.round(der),
      stripe_product_name: stripePricing?.productName,
    },
  }, {
    onConflict: 'plan_id,dog_id,recipe_id'
  })
  .select("id")
  .single()
```

### 2. Benefits of the Fix

- âœ… **Eliminates Race Conditions**: No more checking for existing items and then deciding to insert/update
- âœ… **Handles Duplicates Gracefully**: If item exists, it updates; if not, it creates
- âœ… **Simpler Code**: Single operation instead of complex conditional logic
- âœ… **Atomic Operation**: Either succeeds completely or fails completely
- âœ… **Better Performance**: One database call instead of potentially two

### 3. Files Modified

1. **`app/plan-builder/page.tsx`** - Main plan builder
2. **`app/plan-builder/page-simplified.tsx`** - Simplified plan builder

## Expected Results

After this fix:

1. **No More 406 Errors**: Plan item creation will succeed without constraint violations
2. **Successful Checkout**: Users should be able to complete the checkout process
3. **Proper Cart Population**: The checkout page should show the plan items correctly
4. **No Duplicate Items**: The upsert ensures no duplicate plan items are created

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Create a new plan** with a dog and recipe
2. **Check console logs** - should see successful plan item creation without 406 errors
3. **Verify checkout page** - should show plan items instead of "No items found in your cart"
4. **Test duplicate creation** - should update existing items instead of failing

## Database Schema

The unique constraint that was causing issues:
```sql
CONSTRAINT ux_plan_items_plan_dog_recipe UNIQUE (plan_id, dog_id, recipe_id)
```

This constraint ensures that each combination of plan, dog, and recipe can only have one plan item, which is the correct business logic. The fix ensures the application respects this constraint properly.

## Related Issues Resolved

This fix also resolves:
- âœ… **Dog duplicate detection** - The "Dog already exists" warning was correct behavior
- âœ… **Plan item creation failures** - Now handles existing items gracefully
- âœ… **Checkout page empty cart** - Plan items should now appear correctly
- âœ… **Authentication loop** - Previous fixes ensure smooth auth flow

The checkout process should now work end-to-end without errors! ðŸš€
