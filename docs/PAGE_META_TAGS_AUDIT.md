## 💡 Special Considerations

### Dynamic Recipe Pages
These need special attention because:
- Each recipe should target specific keywords (e.g., "beef dog food recipe")
- Should include Recipe schema markup for rich snippets
- Meta descriptions should highlight benefits specific to that recipe
- Need to mention "picky eaters" and local delivery in each

**Implementation:** Should use `generateMetadata()` in Next.js to create dynamic meta tags based on recipe data.

### Calculator Page
This is a **HIGH VALUE** SEO opportunity:
- "dog calorie calculator" = 14,800 searches/month
- Should include SoftwareApplication schema
- Should have thorough content explaining DER/RER
- Great link magnet for other pet sites
